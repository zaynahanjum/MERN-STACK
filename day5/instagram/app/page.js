Native to Asia, tigers are apex predators that rely on stealth and strength to hunt. They are territorial and often dwell in forests, grasslands, and mangroves. Despite their fearsome reputation, many tiger species are endangered due to habitat loss and poaching."

Found in Africa and Asia, they are highly intelligent and social animals that live in matriarchal herds. Their trunks serve multiple purposesâ€”from breathing and smelling to grasping objects and communicating. Elephants play a crucial role in their ecosystems, but face threats from habitat destruction and ivory poaching."
